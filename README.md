# Deck-Manager

A simple Windows Form app for cycling through a deck of cards (or any images for that matter) randomly.  Created under the influence because I wanted to play Ankh solo but couldn't be bothered to buy nice cardstock to print the solo AI cards on.

## Instructions
1. Make sure all the card images you want to use are in the same directory and card back files are named with the card front file name + _back (e.g. card1.jpg and card1_back.jpg)
2. Click on "New Deck" and open the folder containing your image files.
3. If you're using double-sided cards, select "Yes" on the prompt that appears.
4. Click "Draw" to draw a card from the deck.  Once the last card is drawn, the deck will automatically be reshuffled to continue drawing seamlessly.
5. Click "Undo" to essentially take the last card drawn and put it back on top of the deck face-down.

## Disclaimer
This software is provided as-is and is definitely buggy and incomplete.  I don't normally code outside of work because I have other hobbies that I'm more passionate about pursuing in my free time.  This was just a random thing I had an urge to slap together over a couple beers one night so I could easily play solo print-and-play variants of board games without needing to print off the cards.  If you run into issues with it, feel free to fork and do your own thing with it, as bug reports will likely go ignored by me.  Nothing personal; I'm just probably painting or playing games instead.
